The hackathon project focuses on creating a Learning Management System (LMS).
Teachers can create courses, upload assignments, and grade student submissions.
Students can enroll in courses, submit assignments, and view their grades and feedback.
The system includes user registration, login, and role-based access (teacher/student).
All data is stored securely in a database (MongoDB or MySQL).
Optional advanced features include AI-assisted grading and discussion forums.
The project must be hosted online and submitted with a GitHub repository and README file.
Judging will be based on functionality, user interface design, code quality, and deployment.

An AI-powered Learning Management System (LMS) for students and teachers, built with Node.js, Express.js, React, and MongoDB.
